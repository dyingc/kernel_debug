Start tracing on a particular function
--------------------------------------

We know 'tracing_on' file is used to disable/enable writing the traces on the ring buffer.

# echo '0' > tracing_on //to disable tracing
# echo '1' > tracing_on // to enable tracing

ftrace also provides functionality to start tracing on a particular function call execution or stop tracing on a particular function execution.

Syntax: function:command[:count]

The command will be executed on the start of the function. The value of command can be
	"traceon" to start the trace
	"traceoff" to stop the trace
	"stacktrace"

The count is optional, specifies the number of times the command should be executed.
If there is no count specified, the command will be executed each time the function is called

# echo 'nop' > current_tracer
# echo 'ksys_read:traceoff:1' > set_ftrace_filter
# cat set_ftrace_filter
# echo 'function' > current_tracer

How to remove this?
-------------------

Using '!' operator

# echo '!ksys_read:traceoff' > set_ftrace_filter
