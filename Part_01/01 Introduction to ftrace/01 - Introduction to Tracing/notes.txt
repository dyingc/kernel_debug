What is tracing?
----------------

A traditional debugger allows you to inspect the system state once the system is halted
	i.e., after an error has been detected, but doesnâ€™t reveal the events leading to the error. 

To understand why an event took place, the relevant context has to be restored. This requires tracing

Tracing is the process of collecting information on the activity in a working system

With tracing, program execution is recorded during run-time, allowing for later analysis of the trace

Tracing provides developers with information useful for debugging.

Difference between tracing and logging
--------------------------------------

Tracing is sometimes compared to logging. Just like logs, tracing data can be read as it is.

With tracing, information is written about low-level events.
These numbers in the hundreds or even thousands.

With logging, information is written about higher-level events, which are much less frequent
These includes users logging into the system, application errors, database transaction etc
