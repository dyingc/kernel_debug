net
-------

Two important data structures of Linux Kernel network layer are:

	sk_buff 

	net_device
	

sk_buff or skb
---------------

	sk_buff means socket buffers. 

	Every packet sent or received is handled using this data structure

	 Packet received by the network card into put into a sk_buff and then passed to the network stack, which uses the skbuff all the time.

net_device
----------
	Structure representing a network device

Functions
------------
	Once the packet is received by the interrupt handler, it copies into skb and calls netif_rx
	netdev_start_xmit is the place where transmission happens: xmit_one in net/dev/core.c file
