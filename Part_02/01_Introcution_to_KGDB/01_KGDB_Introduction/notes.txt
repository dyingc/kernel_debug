Kernel Debugging using GDB
---------------------------

User space processes can be debugged using gdb. With gdb you can
	single-step,
	stop,
	resume,
	put break-points,
	inspect memory and variables,
	look through call stack information

What if we can use gdb on running Linux Kernel.


Problem:
----------

How can a gdb debug running kernel as it is just a user space process.


Solution:
----------

Client/Server Architecture
User space programs can be debugged remotely using the combination of gdbserver on the target machine and gdb on the host machine/development machine.

The Linux kernel has a GDB Server implementation called KGDB. It communicates with a GDB client over network or serial port connection
