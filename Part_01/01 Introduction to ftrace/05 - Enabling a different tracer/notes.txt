How to enable a tracer?
------------------------

$ echo 'name of tracer' > current_tracer 

$ echo 'function' > current_tracer

$ echo 'function_graph' > current_tracer

$ echo 'nop' > current_tracer

Viewing the trace
---------------------

'trace' is the file where tracing data is saved in human-readable format

$ cat trace

Those are functions that are happening on the computer right now

You can see from the cat output:
	First line specifies the tracer installed, in our case "function"
	Next each line prints the following information:
		Process Name
		PID
		CPU that the trace executed on
		Timestamp in seconds with the decimal places to microseconds. This timestamp is time since boot
		Function being traced
		Parent that call the function
