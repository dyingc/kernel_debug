Target Boot with KGDB Support
------------------------------

After your kernel is built with KGDB support, it must be enabled

In general, KGDB is enabled by passing a command line switch to the kernel via the kernel command line.

If KGDB support is compiled into the kernel but not enabled via a command line switch, it does nothing.

When KGDB is enabled, the kernel stops at a KGDB-enabled breakpoint very early in the boot cycle to allow you to connect to the target using gdb

Append the following command line to kernel command line in grub:

	kgdbwait kgdboc=ttyS0,115200

	kgdbdoc: kgdb over console
		 This is a KGDB I/O driver and we are supplying two arguments
		 one informing the kernel to use ttyS0 serial port and the other 115200 baud rate

	kgdwait: Informs the kernel to wait until the debugger is attached
