What happens on Panic?
----------------------

When a kernel panic occurs, then something has gone seriously wrong and the kernel automatically enters debugger mode.

From here you can 
	look at memory,
	do a traceback,
	examine registers, and
	do other operations to find out more about the state of the system and debug the problem.
