Function Filtering
---------------------

The ftrace printout can be big, and finding exactly what it is you're looking for can be extremely difficult.

We can use filters to simplify our search.

The printout will only display information about functions we're interested in.


What functions are available for the filter?
-------------------------------------------
All the functions that can be traced are present in available_filter_functions

Limit What Functions you trace
-------------------------------
If you want only enable few of the functions or disable few of the functions, then you can use the below files

set_ftrace_filter	-	Only trace these functions
set_ftrace_notrace	-	Do not trace these functions
(notrace takes precedence over filter)

Just echo function names into the files
# echo function_name > set_ftrace_filter

Can add multiple (white space delimited)
# echo function1 function2 > set_ftrace_filter

Append with the bash concatenation ">>"
# echo function >> set_ftrace_filter

Clear with just writing nothing to it
# echo > set_ftrace_notrace	

Example:
-------------

# echo function > current_tracer
# echo do_page_fault > set_ftrace_filter
# cat trace

# echo > set_ftrace_filter
# echo kfree > set_ftrace_notrace

# echo vfs_* > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
# echo schedule > set_ftrace_filter

set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace affect function_graph as well

# echo do_IRQ > set_ftrace_filter
# echo function_graph > current_tracer
# cat trace

This shows you the interrupt times, interrupt latencies of all the interrupts that are happening in your system
