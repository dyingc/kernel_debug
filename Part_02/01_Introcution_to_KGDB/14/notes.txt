kgdbcon
--------

kgdb allows you to see printk messages inside gdb, while gdb is connected to the target machine.

There are two ways to activate this feature:

1. Activate with the kernel command line option::

        kgdbcon

2. Use sysfs before configuring an I/O driver::

        echo 1 > /sys/module/debug_core/parameters/kgdb_use_con

Note: If you do this after you configure the kgdb I/O driver, the setting will not take effect until the next point the I/O is reconfigured.

Important Point: You cannot use kgdboc + kgdbcon on a tty that is an active system console. An example of incorrect usage is::
        console=ttyS0,115200 kgdboc=ttyS0 kgdbcon
