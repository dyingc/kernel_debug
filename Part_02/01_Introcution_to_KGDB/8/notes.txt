Enabling KGDB at runtime
------------------------

Suppose, you have a scenario in which you have not enabled KGDB at boot time through kernel command line, but have compiled the kernel with the configuration required for KGDB.

Now if you want to enable the KGDB, run the below commands on the target machine.

Step 1: Specify the serial port, plus baud rate to the kgdboc

#echo "ttyS0,115200" > /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc

Step 2: Run the Sysrq magic sequence

#echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger

On the Host machine it is the same set of commands

Step1: gdb ./vmlinux
Step2: target remote /dev/ttyS0
