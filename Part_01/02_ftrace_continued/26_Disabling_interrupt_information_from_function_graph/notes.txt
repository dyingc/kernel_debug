Disabling interrupts info in function graph
-------------------------------------------

The function graph tracer also traces the interrupts.

Sometimes they clutter the trace

You can tell the function graph tracer to disable tracing of interrupts by writing 0 in 'options/funcgraph-irqs' file.

$ echo 0 > options/funcgraph-irqs

After I disable interrupts, there is no tracing information related to interrupts (e.g. smp_apic_timer_interrupt).

# cat trace | grep -B 5 -A 5 "======>" | head -n 20

# cat trace | grep smp_apic_timer_interrupt

# cat trace | grep smp_apic_timer_interrupt | wc -l
