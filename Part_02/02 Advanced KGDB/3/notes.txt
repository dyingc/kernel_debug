Using Linux Provided GDB Scripts
----------------------------------

Linux kernel has provided a collection of helper scripts which can simplify kernel debugging steps.
You can observe in the linux source directory a file named vmlinux-gdb.py. To use this, copy the below command in ~/.gdbinit

Enable CONFIG_GDB_SCRIPTS

add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/linux-build

List of commands supported by the script can be found by running:

(gdb) apropos lx

Let's try some of the commands.

1. To find out the kernel command line with which the target booted. "lx-cmdline"

2. To find out the list of processes . "lx-ps"

3. To find out list of loaded modules: "lx-lsmod"

4. To find out the version of the current kernel  -  "lx-version"

(gdb) help <command>
