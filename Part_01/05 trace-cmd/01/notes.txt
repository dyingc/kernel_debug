trace-cmd
-------------

ftrace/tracefs is a tool for everyone with Busybox

Everything we did so far used echo or cat. Which makes using ftrace extremely simple on limited systems

But can be very tedious as there are lot of things to remember (what file does for what)

trace-cmd
---------

trace-cmd is a command line tool that interacts with the tracefs (ftrace interface)

With trace-cmd, there is no need to worry about tracefs, it mounts the tracefs automatically

Note: You need to run this command as root

$ sudo apt install trace-cmd

It supports bash completion as well

$ man trace-cmd
