trace vs trace_pipe
----------------------

ftrace internally uses a ring buffer of fixed size. 

The size can be find out by reading "buffer_size_kb" file (and "buffer_total_size_kb" - used for the buffer size of all CPUs).

If the buffer becomes full, it will overwrite the starting tracing entries.

$ cat buffer_size_kb
1410

To read this ring buffer, we can cat either of the two files present in /sys/kernel/tracing folder:
trace
trace_pipe


trace is a non-consuming read. It pauses the tracing when you are reading
trace_pipe is consumer. It doesn't stop the tracing

Each time you read the contents of "trace" file it will print the same tracing entries, whereas with trace_pipe, each time you read the file the data is consumed, and in the next read data will be different also if there is no data trace_pipe will block.

# echo 0 > tracing_on
# cat trace
# cat trace
# cat trace_pipe
# cat trace_pipe
