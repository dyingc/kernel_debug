Important files in tracefs
----------------------------
All manipulations are done with simple files operations (echo/cat) in tracefs

ftrace is built around smart lockless ring buffer implementation.

This buffer stores all the tracing information and is exposed as a file in tracefs

=================

Lists which tracers are configured

Important ones are:

	nop	 	-	No Action (No Tracer Enabled)
	function 	-	Trace Kernel Functions Entry
	function_graph	-	Trace Kernel Functions Entry and Exit  thus allowing to build a call graph
	blk		-	Block Tracer/blktrace
	mmiotrace	-	Trace interactions between drivers and hardware

Default tracer is nop
