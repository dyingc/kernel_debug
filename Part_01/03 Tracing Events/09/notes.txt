Event Tracing via the ‘set_event’ interface
----------------------------------------------

The events which are available for tracing can be found in the file: /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events

To enable a particular event, such as ‘sched_wakeup’, simply echo it to /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_event.

# echo sched_wakeup >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_event

Note: ‘>>’ is necessary, otherwise it will firstly disable all the events.

To disable an event, echo the event name to the set_event file prefixed with an exclamation point

# echo '!sched_wakeup' >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_event

To disable all events, echo an empty line to the set_event file:

# echo > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_event

To enable all events, echo *:* or *: to the set_event file:

# echo *:* > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_event

The events are organized into subsystems, such as ext4, irq, sched, etc., and a full event name looks like this: <subsystem>:<event>.

The subsystem name is optional, but it is displayed in the available_events file.

All of the events in a subsystem can be specified via the syntax <subsystem>:*; for example, to enable all irq events, you can use the command:

# echo 'irq:*' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_event
