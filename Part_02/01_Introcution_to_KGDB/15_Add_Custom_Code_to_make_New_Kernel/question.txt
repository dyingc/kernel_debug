What happens if I modify the kernel code and load the new image?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy the hello.c to the Target VM
2. In the Target VM
  2.1 Copy the hello.c to the `kernel` folder inside the kernel-to-be-built. eg: /usr/src/linux-5.4.0/kernel
  2.2 Modify the `kernel/Makefile` to add:
    obj-y += hello.o
  2.3 Build the kernel (`cd /usr/src/linux-5.4.0; make -j<#_of_cpu_cores>`)
  2.4 As we didn't change any module (we directly add the `hello` to the kernel itself, there's no need to run `make modules_install`
  2.5 Install the new, updated kernel: `sudo make install`
  2.6 You need to re-copy the `vmlinux` as the kernel is changed (without this re-copy, similar issue happens as you haven't correctly chosen the right kernel to start)
