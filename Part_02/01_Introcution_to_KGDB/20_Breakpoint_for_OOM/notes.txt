Out of Memory Error
---------------------

When the running processes require more memory than physically available,
Linux Kernel employs the OOM Killer to review all running processes and kill one or more of them in order to free up system memory and keep the system running

(gdb) break oom_kill_process


How to generate OOM?
-----------------------

$ apt install stress

$ stress --vm-bytes 3000M -m 5


Explanation of stress command
-------------------------------

`--vm-bytes 3000M`: 3000MB memory allocated for each process
`-m 5`: 5 worker processes

So altogether 15GB memory will be stressed up.
