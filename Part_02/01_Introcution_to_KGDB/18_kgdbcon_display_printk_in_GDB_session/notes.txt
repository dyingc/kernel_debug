kgdbcon
--------

kgdb allows you to see printk messages inside gdb, while gdb is connected to the target machine.

There are two ways to activate this feature:

1. Activate with the kernel command line option::

        kgdbcon

2. Use sysfs before configuring an I/O driver::

        echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/debug_core/parameters/kgdb_use_con

Note:
- If you do this after you configure the kgdb I/O driver, the setting will not take effect until the next point the I/O is reconfigured (disconnect the kGDB session or you'll see "kgdboc: Cannot reconfigure while KGDB is connected." in the kernel log. But better to restart both the Target VM and Dev VM).

Important Point: You cannot use kgdboc + kgdbcon on a tty that is an active system console. An example of incorrect usage is::
        console=ttyS0,115200 kgdboc=ttyS0 kgdbcon

So, you need to remove the "console=ttyS0,115200" from the /etc/default/grub's `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` (do not forget to run `sudo update grub2`). The remaining items might look like:

Before:
--------
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nokaslr console=ttyS0,115200 kgdboc=ttyS0,115200 kgdbwait"

After:
--------
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nokaslr kgdboc=ttyS0,115200 kgdbwait kgdbcon"

Note, if you add `kgdbcon` directly into the above kernel command line or use the `/sys/module/debug_core/parameters/kgdb_use_con`.

After this, you might need to disable the previous `agent-proxy` setting.
