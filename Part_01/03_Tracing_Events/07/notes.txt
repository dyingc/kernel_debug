Event Triggers
----------------

Make a event do something special
        Turn off tracing
        Turn on tracing
        Take a "snapshot"
        Produce a stack dump
        Enable another event
        Disable another event

What does a trigger do?

        Trigger actually allows you to make an action happens on a trace event
	Whenever a trace event with attached triggers is invoked, the set of trigger commands associated with that event is invoked. 

Syntax:
---------
Triggers are added by echoing the command to the ‘trigger’ file:

# echo 'command[:count] [if filter]' > trigger

Triggers are removed by echoing the same command but starting with ‘!’ to the ‘trigger’ file

# echo '!command[:count] [if filter]' > trigger
You can ignore [if filter] part while removing triggers

Following commands are supported:
----------------------------------

enable_event/disable_event: 
	These commands can enable or disable another trace event whenever the triggering event is hit.

Format:
---------

enable_event:<system>:<event>[:count]
disable_event:<system>:<event>[:count]

# echo 'enable_event:kmem:kmalloc:1' > \
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_enter_read/trigger

# echo 'disable_event:kmem:kmalloc' > \
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_exit_read/trigger

sys_enter_* used to get function arguments and sys_exit_* to get return value

To remove the above commands:

# echo '!enable_event:kmem:kmalloc:1' > \
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_enter_read/trigger

# echo '!disable_event:kmem:kmalloc' > \
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/syscalls/sys_exit_read/trigger

stacktrace:
	This command dumps a stacktrace in the trace buffer whenever the triggering event occurs.

Format:
----------

stacktrace[:count]

# echo 'stacktrace' > \
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger

# echo 'stacktrace:5 if bytes_req >= 65536' > \
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger

To remove the above commands:

# echo '!stacktrace' > \
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger

# echo '!stacktrace:5 if bytes_req >= 65536' > \
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger

The latter one can also be removed without adding the filter
# echo '!stacktrace:5' > \
      /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger

Other commands:
-----------------

snapshot:
	This command causes a snapshot to be triggered whenever the triggering event occurs.

traceon/traceoff:
	These commands turn tracing on and off when the specified events are hit

hist:
	Histogram specific
