trace-cmd extract
-----------------

trace-cmd extract is usually used after trace-cmd-start and trace-cmd-stop

It can be used after the Ftrace tracer has been started manually through the Ftrace pseudo file system

The extract command creates a trace.dat file that can be used by trace-cmd-report to read from

It reads the kernel internal ring buffer to produce the trace.dat file
