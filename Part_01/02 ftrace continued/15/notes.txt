Capturing Ftrace to oops when kernel panic
-------------------------------------------

You can capture the function calls leading up to a panic using ftrace

Two Ways:
---------

Boot time:
----------

Add the following to kernel command line: ftrace_dump_on_oops

Run time:
---------

# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_dump_on_oops

will enable Ftrace to dump to the console the entire trace buffer in ASCII format on oops or panic

Having the console output to a serial log makes debugging crashes much easier.

You can now trace back the events that led up to the crash.

Dumping to the console may take a long time since the default Ftrace ring buffer is over a megabyte per CPU.

To shrink the size of the ring buffer, write the number of kilobytes you want the ring buffer to be to buffer_size_kb.

[tracing]# echo 50 > buffer_size_kb
The above will shrink the Ftrace ring buffer down to 50 kilobytes per CPU
