trace-cmd record
-----------------

# trace-cmd record [options] [command]

trace-cmd record accepts the same command as trace-cmd start. But it has more functionality. It

	will set up the Ftrace Linux Kernel tracer to record the specified (plugin or event)
	creates a number of tracing processes (one per CPU) that will record from the kernel ring buffer straight into temporary files.
	combines all the files into trace.dat file

trace-cmd record with or without a user command. If no command is specified, it will record until CTRL+C is pressed.

# trace-cmd record -p function
# trace-cmd record -p function_graph
# trace-cmd record -p function ls

Buffers of ftrace are per-cpu.
trace-cmd uses per_cpu/cpuX/trace_pipe_raw file
Reads the binary data directly from the ring buffer.

-F:
        This will filter only the executable that is given on the command line
        Using -F will let you trace only events that are caused by the given command

# trace-cmd record -F -p function ls

trace-cmd report
----------------

Output a human readable report of a trace created by a trace-cmd record

# trace-cmd report

To get the list of events
# trace-cmd report --events

To get only functions
# trace-cmd report -f


-k option of record:
-------------------
        By default, when trace-cmd is finished tracing, it will reset the buffers and disable all the tracing that it enabled
        This option keeps trace-cmd from disabling the tracer and reseting the buffer.

Example
----------

# trace-cmd record -p function -l do_page_fault

# trace-cmd report
