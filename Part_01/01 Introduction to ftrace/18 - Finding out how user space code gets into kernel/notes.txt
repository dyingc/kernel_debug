Finding out how user space code gets into kernel
------------------------------------------------

We can find out what is the first kernel function called when the user space code gets into the kernel using 'max_graph_depth' file

Note: This can be used only with function_graph tracer

max_graph_depth file contains the maximum depth it will trace into a function

Default value: 0 - This means unlimited

If you 'echo 1 > max_graph_depth', it will only the trace the first function and ignore the other functions.

# cat trace

'do_syscall_64()' is the function through which the user space code gets into the kernel space.

If we want to find out the next function after 'do_syscall_64()':

# 'echo 2 > max_graph_depth'

# echo 0 > tracing_on

# echo 1 > max_graph_depth

# echo function_graph > current_tracer

# sh -c 'echo $$ > set_ftrace_pid; echo 1 > tracing_on; exec echo hello'

# cat trace
