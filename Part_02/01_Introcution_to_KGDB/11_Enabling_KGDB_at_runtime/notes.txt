Enabling KGDB at runtime
------------------------

Suppose, you have a scenario in which you have not enabled KGDB at boot time through kernel command line, but have compiled the kernel with the configuration required for KGDB.


Target VM side
----------------

Now if you want to enable the KGDB, run the below commands on the target machine.

Step 1: Specify the serial port, plus baud rate to the kgdboc

$ echo "ttyS0,115200" | sudo tee /sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc # Note: if this is the second Target, use "/dev/ttyS1" if it's using "com2" (\\.\pipe\com2) in the VM setting.

Step 2: Run the Sysrq magic sequence

$ echo g | sudo tee /proc/sysrq-trigger


Dev VM side
-------------

On the Host/Dev machine it is the same set of commands

Step1: $ sudo gdb ./vmlinux
Step2: (gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0 # Note: if the Target is the 2nd one, use "/dev/ttyS1" if it's using "com2" (\\.\pipe\com2) in the VM setting.
