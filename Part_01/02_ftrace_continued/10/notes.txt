trace_marker
----------------
Seeing what happens inside the kernel gives the user a better understanding of how their system works

But sometimes there needs to be coordination between what is happening in user space and what is happening inside the kernel

Let's say you are doing something in the user space and you want to synchronize with the tracing, trace_marker file was created

It provides a way to write into the Ftrace ring buffer from user space.

# echo nop > current_tracer
# echo 'hello world!' > trace_marker
# cat trace
Whatever you wrote is in the trace buffer
