Function Filtering
-------------------

-l function_name

This will limit the function and function_graph tracers to only trace the given function name.

More than one -l may be specified on the command line to trace more than one function.

The limited use of glob expressions are also allowed. 

	match* to only filter functions that start with match
	*match to only filter functions that end with match
	*match\* to only filter on functions that contain match

# trace-cmd start -p function -l do_page_fault
# trace-cmd stat

# trace-cmd start -p function -l do_page_fault -l vfs_read
# trace-cmd stat

# trace-cmd start -p function -l do_page_fault -l vfs_*
# trace-cmd stat

# trace-cmd reset
# trace-cmd stat
