Function Graph Tracer
---------------------

Function Graph Tracer is built on top of Function Tracer.
It also records the return address. By this you will come to know when a function enters and function exits.

$ echo function_graph > current_tracer 

Function_graph tracer
	tracks the entry of the function
	tracks the exit of the function
	Execution Time
	CPU on which it is running

Important Points
----------------
Start of the function is denoted with '{' and end of the function is denoted with '}'. 
Functions that do not call any other functions, simply end with ';', also called as leaf functions
Duration column reports the time spent in the corresponding function. These numbers are only for the leaf functions, and the '}' symbol.

When the duration is greater than 10 microseconds, a '+' is shown in the DURATION column
When the duration is greater than 100 microseconds, a '-' is shown in DURATION column
When the duration is greater than 1000 microseconds, a '#' is shown in DURATION column
When the duration is greater than 10 milliseconds, a '*' is shown in DURATION column
When the duration is greater than 100 milliseconds, a '@' is shown in DURATION column
When the duration is greater than 1 seconds, a '$' is shown in DURATION column
