Debugging Problems
------------------

If you are having problems connecting or something is going seriously wrong while debugging, you can enable remote debug.


Dev VM
--------

(gdb) set debug remote 1
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0 # Because we're in "debug" mode, here we can see a lot of packet sending/receiving and ACK lines indicating if the packets successfully sent or received
(gdb) <any_gdb_command> # We can see a lot of packet sending/receiving and ACK lines indicating if the packets successfully sent or received
(gdb) set debug remote 0 # default, disable the debug mode so that those packet sending/receiving won't come out
