irq_handler_entry:
	called immediately before the irq action handler
	prints contains various information about the handler such as device name and device id

irq_handler_exit:
	called immediately after the irq action handler returns
	irq_handler_exit can be used in conjuction with irq_handler_entry to find out interrupt latencies

softirq_entry:
	called immediately before the softirq handler

softirq_exit:
	called immediately after the softirq handler returns

softirq_raise:
