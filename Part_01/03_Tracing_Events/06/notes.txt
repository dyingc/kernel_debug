Subsystem filters
--------------------

Filters for every event in a subsystem can be set or cleared as a group by writing a filter expression into the filter file at the root of the subsystem

Note:
----
The filter for that event retains its previous setting 
	if a filter for any event within the subsystem lacks a field specified in the subsystem filter,
	if the filter canâ€™t be applied for any other reason

Only filters that reference just the common fields can be guaranteed to propagate successfully to all events

Example 1
-----------
#cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/signal
# echo 'sig==14' > filter
# cat signal_deliver/filter
# cat signal_generate/filter


Example 2
----------
# cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched
# echo common_pid == 0 > filter
# cat sched_switch/filter
common_pid == 0
# cat sched_wakeup/filter
common_pid == 0

Example 3
------------
# cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched
# echo prev_pid == 0 > filter
# cat sched_switch/filter
prev_pid == 0
# cat sched_wakeup/filter
common_pid == 0
