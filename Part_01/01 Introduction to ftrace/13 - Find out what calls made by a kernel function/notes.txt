Filtering function graph tracing
--------------------------------

set_graph_function: 
	
	Similar to set_ftrace_filter
	Functions listed in this file will cause the function graph tracer to only trace these functions and the functions that they call

What's the benefit
------------------

Useful to find out what calls made by a kernel function

Eg. 
# echo vfs_read > set_graph_function
# echo function_graph > current_tracer

set_graph_notrace 

	 Disable function graph tracing when the function is hit until it exits the function.
