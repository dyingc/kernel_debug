gdbtui
---------

The `list` command can be used to display the source code in gdb, but the list doesn't highlight the line which it is executing.

Solution: gdbtui

The gdb Text User Interface (TUI) is a terminal interface which uses the curses library to show the source file, the assembly output, the program registers and gdb commands in separate text windows.


Run
---------

$ sudo gdb --tui vmlinux
