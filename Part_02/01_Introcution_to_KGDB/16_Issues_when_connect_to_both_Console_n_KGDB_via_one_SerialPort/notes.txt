What is "Console"
-------------------

Here the "console" means the "screen" you see as if you're sitting in front of a real computer.


Enable console and KGDB at same serial port
---------------------------------------------

In the Target VM's `/etc/default/grub`, append the following to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`:

console=ttyS0,115200 kgdboc=ttyS0,115200 kgdbwait

So the value becomes:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash nokaslr console=ttyS0,115200 kgdboc=ttyS0,115200 kgdbwait"

And then, don't forget to run: `sudo update-grub2`


Connect to console (Target VM)
--------------------------------

From Dev VM, run: `sudo screen /dev/ttyS0 11520`

Now, you even see the console information when the Target VM is rebooted.


Issue
-------

Now, the issue is, a serial port can be used for only once. So if this `/dev/ttyS0` has been used for console, it usually can't be used for KGDB (unless you open another serial port from the Virtualbox console).

Please refer to the next notes about how to multiply/proxy the single serial port for different purposes.
