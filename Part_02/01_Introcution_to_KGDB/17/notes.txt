Pretty Print
---------------

(gdb) b vfs_read
(gdb) c
(gdb) p file
(gdb) p *file

This format is not the easiest to understand, but there is a way to make it better: the command 'set print pretty' causes gdb to structure printouts in a more appealing manner
(gdb) set print pretty
(gdb) p *file

The disadvantage of this method, of course, is that it takes up much more space on the screen. Itâ€™s not uncommon to find that the printout of a structure takes up several hundred lines.
