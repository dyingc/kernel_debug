Kernel function profiling
----------------------------

From Wikipedia, function profiling provides you the following :

	Space or Time Complexity of a Program
	Usage of Particular Instruction
	Frequency and duration of function calls

ftrace can provide you the following function profiling information using 'function_profiling_enabled' file. 

	Frequency of function calls (When the tracer is 'function')
	Duration spent in each function calls (When the tracer is 'function_graph')

Steps for Function profiling:
-----------------------------

1. Enable the function tracer: 'function'/'function_graph'
# echo 'function' > current_tracer
2. Enable the function profiling:
# echo '1' > function_profile_enabled

Observing Results
-----------------

To observe the results look into '/sys/kernel/tracing/trace_stat' folder.

You will observe a lot of file with the following name: function<number> (e.g. function0, function1,...), where number represents the core on which the function is executing.
