KGDB on Qemuarm
----------------
1. Build core-image-minimal image with the required kernel configuration: bitbake core-image-minimal

2. Build and install SDK : Needed for gdb : Two ways:
	a. bitbake -c populate_sdk core-image-minimal : 
		Build the SDK that matches the image
		Best for a production build that can be used later for debugging, especially during long term maintenance
	b. bitbake meta-toolchain :
		Creates a smaller than typical SDK
		Contains a minimal set of components

3. Run the QEMU

$ runqemu bootparams="nokaslr kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdbwait" qemuparams="-serial tcp::1234,server,nowait"

In above command we are connecting qemu emulated serial port to localhost:1234

4. Get into workdir of virtual kernel: bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep ^WORKDIR=
$GDB ./vmlinux
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
