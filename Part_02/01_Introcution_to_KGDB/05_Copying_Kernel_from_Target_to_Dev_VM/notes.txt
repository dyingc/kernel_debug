Copy "vmlinux" file to Target VM
---------------------------------

$ scp vmlinux dev:udemy/kernel


Configure the Target VM
---------------------------------

From the VirtualBox console, do

- Shutdown the Target VM
- In the Settings -> Network, choose
  - Attached to: Bridged Adapter
  - Advanced -> Promiscuous Mode: Allow All

For Developer VM
- Attached to: Bridged Adapter
- In the Settings -> Network -> Advanced -> Promiscuous Mode: Allow All


Download the same kernel file
---------------------------------

On dev VM:

$ cd ~/udemy/kernel; mkdir kgdb; mv vmlinux kgdb/; cd kgdb # The "vmlinux" was copied from the Target VM in the previous session
$ kernel_name="linux-5.0" ; wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/${kernel_name}.tar.xz && tar xvf ${kernel_name}.tar.xz


Now, we need to continue to make the Target VM boots in `gdb` support mode.
