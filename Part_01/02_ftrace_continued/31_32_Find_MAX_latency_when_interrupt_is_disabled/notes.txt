Finding out maximum time interrupts are disabled
--------------------------------------------------

When interrupts are disabled, the CPU can not react to any other external event

	timer interrupts
	mouse interrupts

This prevents the timer interrupt from triggering or the mouse interrupt from letting the kernel know of a new mouse event.

The result is a latency with the reaction time.

irqsoff is a tracer which tracks the times in the kernel when interrupts are disabled.

Whenever a new maximum latency is found, the tracer saves the trace leading up to that latency point. 

Each time a new maximum latency is reached, the old saved trace is discarded and the new trace is saved.

By default this tracer may not be enabled in your kernel, you need to re-compile my linux kernel with the following kernel configuration: "CONFIG_IRQSOFF_TRACER"

# cat available_tracers

# echo irqsoff > current_tracer

# echo 1 > tracing_on

# cat trace 

# cat tracing_max_latency
 
To reset the maximum latency, write '0' in 'tracing_max_latency' file.
echo 0 > tracing_max_latency
